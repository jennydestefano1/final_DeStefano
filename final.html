					<h4>From 1992 to 2012, the rate of fatalities from shootings in American schools rose just over 7% per 10,000 students enrolled.</h4>
					<p>According to clinical assistant professor at Northwestern University, Adam Pah, unemployment is the leading cause of the rise in gun violence at schools.</p>
					<p>Upon conducting a merged collection of all accessible datasets regarding gun violence in schools across this 30 year time span, Pah and his team concluded that general economic insecurity is linked to these incidents.</p>
					<p>"You tell everyone that they have to go to school and you enforce it, so that it will lead to job security and life as we generally know it," Pah said. "Then when you have this, essentially, break, you'll have more instances of outbursts where that's not really the case."</p>

					<h4>Historically, California has the highest amount of school shooting occurrences.</h4>
					<p>California accounts for 92 of the 696 total school shooting incidents across the United States from 1990-2020.</p>
					<p>This finding is majorly attributed to population, as other highly-populated states, such as Texas and Florida, also account for a major chunk of the nation's rates of gun violence in schools. Currently, California presides as the most populated state in the country, with a population of close to 40 million, according to <a href=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/CA target=_blank> growth statistics </a> included in the 2020 United States Census. </p>
					<p>However, no state has been spared an instance of gun violence in their schools.</p>
					<p>Rhode Island, South Dakota, Maine and New Hampshire have all endured at least one school shooting incident over the past 30 years, though they account for the lowest occurrences out of all 50 states throughout this timeframe.</p>

					<h4>57.5% of U.S. school shootings from 1990-2020 occurred in high schools, deeming high schools the most probable type of school in which shootings occur.</h4>
					<p>Pah attributes this statistic most to the age of students enrolled in high schools, which typically ranges from 14 to 18.</p>
					<p>Law enforcement officials claim that teenagers may resort to gun violence as a method of resolving internal grief and/or mental health struggles.</p>
					<p>According to former FBI agent Chris Cole in an article for CNN.com, "We continually see poor coping skills and poor conflict resolution skills. And as more them (shootings) occur, it becomes sort of acceptable as 'that's a way I can settle my grievances.'"</p>
					<p>Though high schools are the leading type of academic institution in which incidents of gun violence have occurred, a trened in gun violence at colleges picked up speed in the 2000s.</p>
					<p>"Really, that's going to be a reflection of the percentage of people that actually continue from high school to college," Pah said.</p>

				<h4>The COVID-19 pandemic plays a unique part in current rates.</h4>
					<p>Current data shows a sharp decrease in school shootings, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent implementation of remote schooling. Pah claims that this data trend is strikingly similar to the extreme decreases in gun violence at schools during the summer.</p>
					<p>"Of course, during the pandemic, with remote school, it [the rate of gun violence in schools] effectively dropped to zero," Pah said. "No one's in school, so instances are unbelievably low."</p>
					<p>Still, the pandemic has not stopped gun violence at schools altogether.</p>
					<p>Most recently, 15-year-old Ethan Crumbley opened fire on his fellow students at Oxford High School in Michigan on Nov. 30, 2021. This incident, which killed four students and left several more critically injured, has now led to the prosecution of both Crumbley and his parents, James and Jennifer. As <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/article/oxford-school-shooting-michigan.html targer=_blank> The New York Times and Education Week report </a>, the incident at Oxford High School has been deemed the deadliest school shooting of 2021.</p>
					<p>As for future and current data regarding gun violence in schools, Pah says that both the pandemic and a lack of ongoing research has made it difficult to tell what exactly today's trends are, especially considering the possible after-effects of remote schooling.</p>
					<p>"I haven't seen anyone that's still been collecting data, so I don't have a good sense of what the trend is right now," Pah said. "Post-pandemic, the economic indicators have really separated-- right now, unemployment is going down, but consumer confidence is not going up. You have massive inflation on a month-to-month basis, so it'll be interesting."

        			<p>The data used in this project was majorly compiled by Adam Pah and his team at Northwestern University in their study, <a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0040 target=_blank>"Economic insecurity and the rise in gun violence at US schools," </a> which itself is a merged collection of multiple datasets. My findings also synthesize data from the <a href=https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/time-series/demo/school-enrollment-cps-historical-time-series.html target=_blank> U.S. Census Bureau </a> regarding school enrollment, a live interview with Pah himself (which was conducted via Zoom on December 9, 2021), and secondary sourcing from CNN's article, <a href=https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/07/us/ten-years-of-school-shootings-trnd/ target=_blank> "10 years. 180 school shootings. 365 victims," </a> which encompasses more recent data and quotes from law enforcement officials.</p>
        			<p>According to Pah, the team at Northwestern University qualified and defined a school shooting as any incident of gun violence at schools, so long as it occurred on a school campus and involved students. This means that the data excludes any instances where gun violence may have occurred while school was not in session.</p>
        			<p>It should be noted that the COVID-19 pandemic poses an important limitation to this data, as current numbers are likely skewed and not reflective of any major changes in legislation.</p>
